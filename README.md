# Premier-League-Betting-Odds-Models
The dataset from Kaggle covers all Premier League matches since 1993, including results, goals, penalties, and Bet365 betting odds (from 2002-2003). The goal is to build models predicting betting odds, aiding betting companies in setting odds or identifying favorable bets when model odds differ significantly from set odds.
